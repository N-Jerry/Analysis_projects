# 📊 Student Test Score Analysis with Power BI

This Power BI project explores student performance data to investigate how factors like **tutoring** and **extracurricular activities** affect academic outcomes. The focus is on identifying patterns and testing hypotheses around **math** and **reading scores**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goal is to use interactive visuals to answer key questions, such as:

- Does tutoring improve test scores?
- Which extracurricular activities are linked to higher academic performance?
- Are there score trends across districts, states, or school years?
- How do demographic or regional factors play a role?

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)

Before building visuals, the data was cleaned and shaped using **Power Query Editor**:
 
- Replaced blank values with nulls   
- Standardized column names for clarity  
- Created merged columns such as **City state** from both ***City*** and ***State*** columns 
- Ensured correct data types for numerical and categorical fields  

This step ensured the data was analysis-ready and well-structured for reporting.

## 📈 Tools & Features Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- Data modeling (relationships, calculated columns)
- DAX for KPIs (average score, score improvements, etc.)
- Drilldowns and filters for district, grade, and state-level views

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Students who received tutoring for longer periods generally had better scores  
- Some extracurricular activities correlated with higher academic performance  
- Score differences were visible across districts and grade levels  
- Power BI made it easy to explore data by year, location, and tutoring level
