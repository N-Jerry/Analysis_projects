# 📊 Data Analysis Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Analysis Projects Portfolio**! This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects that showcase my skills in analyzing, transforming, and visualizing data using four essential tools and technologies:

- **SQL** – for data querying and extraction  
- **Pandas (Python)** – for data manipulation and analysis  
- **Excel** – for spreadsheet-based reporting and calculations  
- **Power BI** – for building interactive dashboards and business insights

Each project solves a real-world problem using publicly available or synthetic datasets, and includes well-documented steps from data cleaning to final insight generation.
